![A room with measuring instruments in it.](/coursemedia/8-13-14-experimental-physics-i-ii-junior-lab-fall-2016-spring-2017/e656a0c8f3969047699a48dd7061b1b8_L31.jpg)

A cooled intrinsic germanium solid-state X-ray detector.

This experiment investigates the production and absorption of x-rays. A cooled intrinsic germanium solid-state x-ray detector is used to measure the spectra of x-rays under a variety of circumstances that illustrate several of the important phenomena of x-ray physics. Phenomena observed and measured include the production of x-rays by fluorescent excitation, bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation and the absorption of x-rays by photoelectric interactions, Compton scattering, and pair production.

The energies of the K x-ray lines of numerous elements are measured and compared with the predictions of Moseley's Law. The energy separations and relative intensities of the Ka and Kb lines are measured and compared with the theory of fine structure in the n=2 orbitals.
